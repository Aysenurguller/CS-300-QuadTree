# CS-300-QuadTree
A point quadtree is “a multidimensional generalization of a binary search tree” to store and query 2D points. For further details, see the attached document taken from the book titled “Design &amp; Analysis of Spatial Data Structures” by Hanan Samet.


Your program should read two text files, namely cities.txt and queries.txt. While the former
specifies a two-dimensional space together with some cities located in this space, the latter
specifies the queries to be answered.
